# DevRel CFP Committee - Development Summary

## Project Overview

This project processes Call for Papers (CFP) session submissions using AI agents to evaluate and score proposals. The system provides persistent database storage with resume capability, making it suitable for production use with large datasets. The system now includes comprehensive speaker management with many-to-many relationships between speakers and sessions.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Database Persistence with SQLite
**Decision**: Use Node.js built-in SQLite support instead of external databases
**Reasoning**: 
- Zero external dependencies for database operations
- Built-in support via `sqlite3` and `sqlite` packages
- Perfect for single-instance deployments
- File-based storage simplifies backup and deployment

### 2. Status-Based Processing System
**Decision**: Implement status tracking ('new' vs 'ready') for session processing
**Reasoning**:
- Enables resume capability after interruptions
- Handles rate limits and API failures gracefully
- Allows for partial processing of large datasets
- Provides clear visibility into processing state

### 3. Comprehensive Export System
**Decision**: Implement both JSON and CSV export formats
**Reasoning**:
- JSON for programmatic integration and backup
- CSV for spreadsheet analysis and reporting
- Proper handling of multiline text in CSV exports
- Maintains data integrity across export formats

### 4. Speaker-Session Many-to-Many Relationship
**Decision**: Implement normalized database structure with junction table
**Reasoning**:
- Proper database normalization eliminates data redundancy
- Junction table (`session_speakers`) enables true many-to-many relationships
- Sessions can have multiple speakers, speakers can have multiple sessions
- Maintains referential integrity with foreign key constraints
- Scalable design for future speaker management features

## Core Components

3. **Rate Limit Handling**: Can pause and resume when hitting API limits
4. **Detailed Tracking**: Individual score fields for easy querying
5. **Status Management**: Clear status tracking for each session
6. **Speaker Integration**: Comprehensive speaker management with proper relationships

## Database Schema Design

### Sessions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- Session id primary key text field
  title TEXT NOT NULL,              -- Session title
  session_data TEXT NOT NULL,       -- JSON stringified session data
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'new', -- Processing status
  evaluation_results TEXT,          -- JSON stringified evaluation results
  title_score INTEGER,              -- Individual score fields
  title_justification TEXT,         -- Individual justification fields
  description_score INTEGER,
  description_justification TEXT,
  key_takeaways_score INTEGER,
  key_takeaways_justification TEXT,
  given_before_score INTEGER,
  given_before_justification TEXT,
  evaluation_score_total INTEGER,   -- Calculated total score
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,        -- Timestamps
  completed_at TEXT
);
```

### Speakers Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE speakers (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- Speaker id primary key
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,         -- Speaker first name
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,          -- Speaker last name
  full_name TEXT NOT NULL,          -- Speaker full name
  bio TEXT NOT NULL,                -- Speaker biography
  tag_line TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Speaker tagline/title
  profile_picture TEXT NOT NULL,    -- Profile picture URL
  is_top_speaker BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, -- Top speaker flag
  sessions TEXT NOT NULL,           -- JSON stringified sessions array
  links TEXT NOT NULL,              -- JSON stringified links array
  question_answers TEXT NOT NULL,   -- JSON stringified Q&A array
  categories TEXT NOT NULL,         -- JSON stringified categories array
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL         -- Timestamp
);
```

### Session-Speakers Junction Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE session_speakers (
  session_id TEXT NOT NULL,         -- Foreign key to sessions
  speaker_id TEXT NOT NULL,         -- Foreign key to speakers
  PRIMARY KEY (session_id, speaker_id), -- Composite primary key
  FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES sessions(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (speaker_id) REFERENCES speakers(id)
);
```

### Design Rationale:
- **Individual Score Fields**: Enable efficient querying and reporting
- **JSON Storage**: Preserve complex nested data structures
- **Total Score**: Pre-calculated for performance and consistency
- **Timestamps**: Track processing duration and timing
- **Normalized Speaker Data**: Eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity
- **Junction Table**: Enable true many-to-many relationships with referential integrity

## Evaluation Criteria

The system evaluates sessions on four criteria (1-5 scale each):
- **Title**: Clarity, engagement, and descriptiveness
- **Description**: How well it explains content, value, and target audience
- **Key Takeaways**: Value and actionability of provided takeaways
- **Given Before**: Whether the speaker has presented this talk before

**Total Score Range**: 4-20 (minimum 1 per category, maximum 5 per category)

## Speaker Management Features

### Speaker Data Integration
- **Source**: Speakers loaded from `speakers.json` fixture
- **Correlation**: Based on speaker IDs in session data's `speakers` array
- **Relationship**: Many-to-many via `session_speakers` junction table
- **Export**: Speaker information included in all export formats

### Speaker Statistics
- **Total Speakers**: Count of all speakers in database
- **Speakers with Sessions**: Count of speakers who have submitted sessions
- **Top Speakers**: Count of speakers marked as top speakers
- **Session Distribution**: How many sessions each speaker has submitted

### Speaker Views and Exports
- **db:view:speakers**: Dedicated speaker view with session details
- **Speaker Information**: Names, taglines, bios, profile pictures, links
- **Session Correlation**: Automatic matching based on session data
- **Export Integration**: Speaker data included in JSON and CSV exports
