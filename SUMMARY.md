# DevRel CFP Committee - Development Summary

## Project Overview

This project processes Call for Papers (CFP) session submissions using AI agents to evaluate and score proposals. The system provides persistent database storage with resume capability, making it suitable for production use with large datasets. The system now includes comprehensive speaker management with many-to-many relationships between speakers and sessions, and separate workflows for session evaluation and speaker assessment.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Database Persistence with SQLite
**Decision**: Use Node.js built-in SQLite support instead of external databases
**Reasoning**: 
- Zero external dependencies for database operations
- Built-in support via `sqlite3` and `sqlite` packages
- Perfect for single-instance deployments
- File-based storage simplifies backup and deployment

### 2. Status-Based Processing System
**Decision**: Implement status tracking ('new' vs 'ready') for session processing
**Reasoning**:
- Enables resume capability after interruptions
- Handles rate limits and API failures gracefully
- Allows for partial processing of large datasets
- Provides clear visibility into processing state

### 3. Comprehensive Export System
**Decision**: Implement both JSON and CSV export formats
**Reasoning**:
- JSON for programmatic integration and backup
- CSV for spreadsheet analysis and reporting
- Proper handling of multiline text in CSV exports
- Maintains data integrity across export formats

### 4. Speaker-Session Many-to-Many Relationship
**Decision**: Implement normalized database structure with junction table
**Reasoning**:
- Proper database normalization eliminates data redundancy
- Junction table (`session_speakers`) enables true many-to-many relationships
- Sessions can have multiple speakers, speakers can have multiple sessions
- Maintains referential integrity with foreign key constraints
- Scalable design for future speaker management features

### 5. Separate Workflow Architecture
**Decision**: Split session evaluation and speaker assessment into independent workflows
**Reasoning**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each workflow has a focused purpose
- **Independent Execution**: Workflows can run separately or together
- **Modularity**: Easy to modify, test, and deploy independently
- **Reusability**: Speaker evaluation can be used without session evaluation
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more workflows or modify existing ones

  session_id TEXT NOT NULL,         -- Foreign key to sessions
  speaker_id TEXT NOT NULL,         -- Foreign key to speakers
  PRIMARY KEY (session_id, speaker_id), -- Composite primary key
  FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES sessions(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (speaker_id) REFERENCES speakers(id)
);
```

### Design Rationale:
- **Individual Score Fields**: Enable efficient querying and reporting
- **JSON Storage**: Preserve complex nested data structures
- **Total Score**: Pre-calculated for performance and consistency
- **Timestamps**: Track processing duration and timing
- **Normalized Speaker Data**: Eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity
- **Junction Table**: Enable true many-to-many relationships with referential integrity

## Evaluation Criteria

### Session Evaluation (CFP Workflow)
The system evaluates sessions on four criteria (1-5 scale each):
- **Title**: Clarity, engagement, and descriptiveness
- **Description**: How well it explains content, value, and target audience
- **Key Takeaways**: Value and actionability of provided takeaways
- **Given Before**: Whether the speaker has presented this talk before

**Total Score Range**: 4-20 (minimum 1 per category, maximum 5 per category)

### Speaker Evaluation (Speaker Workflow)
The system evaluates speakers on two criteria (1-3 scale each):
- **Expertise Match**: How well the speaker's expertise aligns with JavaScript development
- **Topics Relevance**: Relevance of the speaker's typical topics to the conference

**Assessment Features**:
- Uses Playwright tools to visit Sessionize profiles
- Extracts expertise areas and speaking topics
- Provides structured assessments with justifications
- Handles missing profiles gracefully with default scores

## Speaker Management Features

### Speaker Data Integration
- **Source**: Speakers loaded from `speakers.json` fixture
- **Correlation**: Based on speaker IDs in session data's `speakers` array
- **Relationship**: Many-to-many via `session_speakers` junction table
- **Export**: Speaker information included in all export formats

### Speaker Statistics
- **Total Speakers**: Count of all speakers in database
- **Speakers with Sessions**: Count of speakers who have submitted sessions
- **Top Speakers**: Count of speakers marked as top speakers
- **Session Distribution**: How many sessions each speaker has submitted

### Speaker Views and Exports
- **db:view:speakers**: Dedicated speaker view with session details
- **Speaker Information**: Names, taglines, bios, profile pictures, links
- **Session Correlation**: Automatic matching based on session data
- **Export Integration**: Speaker data included in JSON and CSV exports

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Path Resolution
**Challenge**: Mastra executes workflows from `.mastra/output` directory, not project root
**Solution**: Implemented robust path resolution that detects execution environment:
```typescript
// If we're in .mastra/output, go up to the project root
if (projectRoot.includes('.mastra/output')) {
  projectRoot = path.resolve(projectRoot, '../../');
  dbPath = path.join(projectRoot, 'sessions.db');
}
```

### Workflow Separation Benefits
1. **Independent Testing**: Each workflow can be tested separately
2. **Focused Development**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Flexible Execution**: Can run workflows individually or combined
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Simpler to modify and debug individual workflows

### Concurrency Control
- **Speaker Assessment**: Limited to 2 concurrent assessments to avoid rate limits
- **Database Operations**: Proper connection management and cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data or API failures

## Key Insights for Future Development

### 1. Scalability Considerations
- **Concurrency**: Currently set to 1 session at a time for testing. Can be increased for production
